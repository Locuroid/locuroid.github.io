# Google Drive Direct Download Link Converter (GDDDLC).

Besides the acronym, this is actually really cool. This can convert your boring ol' Google Drive Links into links you can download files from directly, just like the name implies.

# [Convert your links!](https://google-drive-ddl.glitch.me)

Maybe I'm a bit biased but I think for your usual making a ddl for .pngs, .zip files, or some random .py file, GDDDLC is a very good converter. It converts the links fast, without need for an API, or annoying ads. It's just good even though there might be some areas where it doesn't work. Paste your link, click convert, click copy and boom. You can use your link anywhere. I might make an API for it when I am free so you can use it wherever.
