# Nachopup
## Nachopup is an open-source Discord bot. It has many different commands that can access vast amounts of information. One can access the weather from their given city, search for Xbox gamertags, search Google knowledge graphs, and find definitions, synonyms, and rhymes to given words.

## You can find more information about this *fantastic* Discord bot I spent many hours making at [Nachopup's more official site](https://nachopup.locuroid.com).
