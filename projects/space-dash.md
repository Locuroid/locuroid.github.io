# Space Dash
Space Dash is a game I made when I was about 13 or 14 when following some online tutorials from a site called Codakid. It's kind of like a worse version of Jetpack Joyride with more bugs and less pickups. 
Anywho. You can play it at [space-dash.locuroid.com](https://space-dash.locuroid.com)
