### They're either not good or just plain confusing.

Bad Fortunes. Your most trusted fortune teller. Just go to the [Bad Fortunes website](https://badfortunes.locuroid.repl.co), hit the space bar and a fortune will be generated.

[Github Repo](https://https://github.com/locuroid/bad-fortune-api). Right now, its main flaw is its lack of words, phrases, etc. If you use the generator you will notice the "This fortune is lying to you" result appear several times. More phrases means less time this happens.

You can also use the API. Endpoint: https://bad-fortune-api.fleece123.repl.co/fortune
